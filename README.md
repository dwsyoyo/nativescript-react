## React + NativeScript = :muscle:

* React declarative, composable API, and speed.
* React is skill that is available / the learning curve is very smooth
* There is a ton a very usefull React-packages available
* React is THE thing anyway 

* Build 100% native cross-platform apps NativeScript, and the ability to implement platform-specific UIs.
* Share 100% of your code, or use platform-specific APIs, depending on the app you‚Äôre building.
* Use standards-based CSS syntax for styling.
* Use rich data binding and existing UI patterns to easily build complex user interfaces.
* Reuse any native library available in Objective-C or Java.
* Reuse any JavaScript library that is not browser-dependent.
* Reuse the QA tools for accessibility automation to write tests.
* Use the latest native platform features to create an amazing native user experience.
* Code in any IDE of your choice to implement your applications‚Äô code using the NativeScript framework's CLI.
* Take a look at the NativeScript CTO guide ( the advantages are better explained ): https://www.nativescript.org/ctos-guide
