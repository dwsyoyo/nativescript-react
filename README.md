* Use standards-based CSS syntax for styling.
* Use rich data binding and existing UI patterns to easily build complex user interfaces.
* Reuse any native library available in Objective-C or Java.
* Reuse any JavaScript library that is not browser-dependent.
* Reuse the QA tools for accessibility automation to write tests.
* Use the latest native platform features to create an amazing native user experience.
* Code in any IDE of your choice to implement your applications‚Äô code using the NativeScript framework's CLI.
